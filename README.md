- In an ***Unknown Environment***, Turtlebot has to drive autonomously until it recognizes a set number of *QR codes*.
- When the robot has recognized a certain number of *QR codes*, it returns to its starting point and stops.
- Measure the final time it took from the time of departure to the time it came to a starting point.
